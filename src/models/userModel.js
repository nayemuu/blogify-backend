/**
 * @middleware Mongoose Pre-Save Hook
 * @description
 * This `pre("save")` middleware is triggered by Mongoose *before* a user document is saved to the database.
 * It is primarily used to hash the password before storage.
 *
 * @triggers
 * ‚úÖ Runs automatically when:
 * - A new document is created and saved using `.save()` or `Model.create()`
 * - An existing document is modified and saved using `.save()`
 *
 * ‚ùå Does NOT run when using update queries like:
 * - `User.updateOne()`
 * - `User.updateMany()`
 * - `User.findOneAndUpdate()` or `findByIdAndUpdate()`
 * These methods bypass middleware and do not call `.save()`.
 *
 *
 * @async_behavior
 * This middleware is declared as an `async` function. In **Mongoose**, async middleware
 * resolves automatically ‚Äî Mongoose waits for the promise to resolve or reject.
 *
 * üî∏ Important Note:
 * - In **Mongoose**, you do NOT need to call `next()` manually inside `async` middleware.
 *   - Mongoose will proceed after the async function resolves.
 * - In contrast, **middleware in other frameworks (e.g., Express)** still requires calling `next()`
 *   to move to the next middleware.
 * - ‚úÖ Best Practice: In Mongoose, avoid mixing `async` and `next()` unless you are:
 *   - Doing manual error handling
 *   - Needing clarity or consistency in larger codebases
 *
 * @example
 * const user = new User({ name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com", password: "secret123" });
 * await user.save(); // --> pre("save") middleware runs here to hash password
 */

  /**
   * Only hash the password if it has been modified (or is new).
   * Prevents unnecessary re-hashing during updates that don‚Äôt touch the password field.

    //request will stuck after uploading this data on MongoDB

   * This ensures secure storage of user passwords in the database.

/**
 * Compares a plain text password with a hashed password to check for a match.
 *
 * @param {string} plainPassword - The password input provided by the user (e.g., from login form).
 * @param {string} hashedPassword - The password stored in the database.
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} - Returns true if passwords match, otherwise false.
 *
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT use arrow functions for Mongoose instance methods.
 * Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context, so `this` won't refer to the document instance.
 * Using a regular function ensures that `this` refers to the Mongoose document.
